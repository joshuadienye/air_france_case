## Air France Case

# Introduction
In this assignment, my team and I were tasked to find a way to improve the marketing campaign of Air France. We were given data with keywords, click costs, revenue, and other variables in the form of an excel document. 

# Conclusion
After going through the data pipeline on the dataset, we were able to create thresholds to determine underperfomring keywords. After removing the keywords that did not meet the threshold (92.92% of all keywords), we saw a 6.40% increase in revenue, a 44.85% decrease in total costs, and a 0.15% decrease in ROA.
